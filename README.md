# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this project, we will work for PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app company, to perform an exploratory analysis of data. 

We will create several types of visualizations by using Matplotlib that showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods, then the company can be more successful.

## Results

As the city gets more urban and more people live, the demand for ride services gets higher. The number of riders and drivers in urban cities is much higher than the number of riders and drivers in rural cities. 

However, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and driver. 

As the city gets more rural, the traveled distance should take longer, and the drivers are lesser. Additionally, the drivers will spend more time on the route, with more gasoline consumed.

Therefore rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

Moreover, urban cities have the highest total fare, and rural cities have the lowest total fare.

## Summary

The percentage between drivers and riders is 62% in rural cities, 78% in suburban cities, and 148% in urban cities. 

On one hand, there are too many drivers in urban cities, thus the average fare per driver is kind of low. On the other hand, there may be too few drivers in rural cities, which may cause the riders to pay more per ride and wait longer to get a driver. 

Overall, the company CEO can considerably decrease the number of urban drivers and increase the number of rural drivers. Furthermore, since all cities have the highest total fare in the middle towards the end of February, more drivers may be needed during that period.
